        and even angry about contracting COVID. Now that you are here, perhaps you feel the same way. Maybe you are thinking that you cannot believe you caught it despite taking all recommended precautions; or perhaps you even thought it could not possibly happen to you. While your mind races and tries to pinpoint the exact moment you went wrong, it will not help. When I had COVID over the 2019 Christmas holidays, I thought these same things. While I am in no way a qualified medical authority, I have put together some information that helped me survive those turbulent days.

          <p>This was my biggest pillar. Someone to talk to about evering that was happening to you. 
            Even thought they wheren't able to help directly, having someone to talk to daily helped releive the stress a little. 
            Just be careful when they visit or get incontact with something you have been using.</p>

          <h4 class="flow-text yellow">Friends & Loved ones</h4>
          <p>Let your freinds know what you have been going through. Don't be ashamed or embarressed. It will isolate you and couse you even more suffering.
             Talk to them maybe about their day. It's a good way to distract your mind and also to connect with the outside world.</p>

          <p>Might not seem like the best place to look for comfort since might feel forsaken. If nothing else, 2020 has tought us that nothing 
            is permanent and man is just a passenger in the grand scheme of things. Even if you don't fully accept the existance of a diety the 
            thought of a supernatural being able to aid you will help you keep hope alive. Hope that you might be one of those individulas that are asymptomatic
            or get through this with mino6r manifestation of symptoms.

            watching entire series in a few days. Finally I recommend watching comedy shows. It will help you bring your spirits up. Even if it's a little.
