      and even angry about. Maybe you took the best car possible and still got it or didn't believe it could happen to you and it did. Either way you are here now. 
      Even though your mind races to find out where you went wrong it won't help. I too had COVID over the 2019 Christmas days. While I am 
      in no way qualified to instruct anyone how to proceed from here I thought I would put together below what helped me survive.

          <p>This was my biggest pillar. Someone to talk to about evering that was happening to you. 
            Even thought they wheren't able to help directly, having someone to talk to daily helped releive the stress a little. 
            Just be careful when they visit or get incontact with something you have been using.</p>

        <div class="col s3">
          <h4 class="flow-text">Friends & Loved ones</h4>
          <p>Let your freinds know what you have been going through. Don't be ashamed or embarressed. It will isolate you and couse you even more suffering.
             Talk to them maybe about their day. It's a good way to distract your mind and also to connect with the outside world.</p>

          <p>Might not seem like the best place to look for comfort since might feel forsaken. If nothing else, 2020 has tought us that nothing 
            is permanent and man is just a passenger in the grand scheme of things. Even if you don't fully accept the existance of a diety the 
            thought of a supernatural being able to aid you will help you keep hope alive. Hope that you might be one of those individulas that are asymptomatic
            or get through this with minor manifestation of symptoms.

          <p>Playing games was was my goto source of distacting myself and wasting time. If possible invest in a streaming service. You will end up 
            watching entire series in a few days. Finally I recommend watching comedy shows. It will help you bring your spirits up. Even if it's a little.
